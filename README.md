Micro16
==========
A Micro16 emulator written in Java. 

Acknowledgements:
* [Dav1dde's Micro16 emulator](https://github.com/Dav1dde/Micro16) written in CoffeeScript, I based my implementation of the memory IO on his version. 
* The original Java Micro16 simulator by David Krywult and the TGI team, I'm using it to verify the correctness of my implementation.
